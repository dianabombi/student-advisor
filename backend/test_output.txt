Testing Context Generation for München:
VERIFIED JOB AGENCIES IN MÜNCHEN:

IMPORTANT: These are main portal pages. Users must search on the portal themselves.

• Zenjob - München
  Website: https://www.zenjob.com/de/jobs/muenchen/
  Instructions: BEST FOR STUDENTS. Open website, download App or search for 'München'
  Description: <MagicMock name='mock.description' id='128515898878288'>
  Specialization: <MagicMock name='mock.specialization' id='128515896948560'>

• StepStone - München
  Website: https://www.stepstone.de/jobs/München?q=Werkstudent
  Instructions: Open website, search for 'Werkstudent' in 'München'
  Description: <MagicMock name='mock.description' id='128515898878416'>
  Specialization: <MagicMock name='mock.specialization' id='128515898543568'>


IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
- DO NOT use Markdown links like [text](URL)
- ALWAYS write URLs as plain text: https://www.example.com
- The frontend will automatically convert URLs to clickable links

IF WEBSITE IS BLOCKED:
- Some portals may block direct access
- Tell users to search Google for: 'portal_name city' (e.g. 'jobs.cz Praha')
- Click the first search result to bypass blocking

REMINDER: Tell users they need to search on the portal themselves after opening the link.
